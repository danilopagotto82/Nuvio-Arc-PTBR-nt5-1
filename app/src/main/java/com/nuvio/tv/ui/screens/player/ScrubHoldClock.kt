/**
 * Timing of a held seek key. A TV remote reaches the box over HDMI-CEC: every repeat arrives as a fresh press
 * (its down time is its own time), some TVs send a tap as two presses about 100 ms apart, and the repeat interval
 * differs per TV (about 100 ms up to 450 ms). A held key first repeats after about 400 ms; presses that follow
 * each other faster from the start are a doubled tap or a backlog the TV sends after the release, and never glide;
 * a backlog that starts right after a release does not even count as a tap.
 * The glide stands still once no repeat has come for twice the longest interval seen in this hold, so it stops
 * close to the release even when the key-up comes late.
